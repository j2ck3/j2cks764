- 👋 Hi, I’m @j2cks764
- 👀 I'm interested in programming, playing games and listen to music.
- 🌱 I'm at school now. Finished 9th grade (In Russia) I want to finish 11th grade and go to university to study information security. I’m learning programming a little (C++/php/js)
- 💞️ It’s not that I’m looking for like-minded people, because it will be difficult to communicate since I hardly know English, and I also have VERY little knowledge of programming languages. But if something happens, I’m ready to try to do something together

- ⚡ Fun fact: One day a British guy goes to India and meets an Indian.
    He approaches him and asks:
    British: “Why do all your girls go around covered up?”
    Indian: *Gives two candies (one in a package, the other without)*
    Indian: “Which candy will you choose?”
    British: “Of course, the packaging is cleaner!”
    Indian: “You see, it’s the same with girls”
    British: *Gives shit. One in the jar, one in the hand*
    British: “Which one will you choose?”
    Indian: “What does shit have to do with it??”
    British: “What does this have to do with sweets?”
    Indian: fuck you redneck.
